Repository for Algorithms and Analysis class. Taken Spring 2018.

## Projects
All projects usually have included a template for certain files from the professor that is modified according to his specifications. All projects are tested using mutiple test cases and run against the professors soltuion. 

**Project 0** 
*Program trace verification.*
>**General Prompt:** Determine the validity of program traces. You'll be given a trace of an executing program, and you should determine whether the trace is valid or not. If it's not valid, your program should describe why.
>
**Project 1**
*Maze solver.*
>**General Prompt:** Write a program that searches through a maze to find a path from the beginning to the end. The maze will be a two-dimensional grid of locations, numbered by row and column.

**Project 2**
*Shortest-path word-melt solver.*
>**General Prompt:** Similar to project 1 but in this project, your program will use  Breadth-First Search, to find shortest paths. However, instead of solving a maze, your program will solve word melt puzzles. 

**Project 3**
*Tree-based encryption and decryption.*
>**General Prompt:** 
Implement a program which implements encryption and decryption using word substitutions rather than letter substitutions. Every word will be comprised only of lowercase alphabet characters.

**Project 5**
*Real-time batch operating system simulator.*
>**General Prompt:** You will write an program that uses a priority queue (heap) to simulate a real-time batch operating system. Your simulator will start new processes running when they are ready, and update the clock when they have finished.
